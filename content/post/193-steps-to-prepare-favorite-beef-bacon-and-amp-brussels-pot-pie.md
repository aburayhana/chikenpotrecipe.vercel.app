- "Pour roux over filling. Ideally, you’ll want to leave more of the bottom dough exposed so that you can get a tight seal with the top crust. I was greedy. I also forgot to add the cheese on top of the roux. Do that. Seal pie and make an air vent. Hit it with the egg wash."
- "Preheat oven to 425 F. Because I forgot to put the cheese inside of the pie I had to put it on top. I also struggled to seal it because I was being greedy with the filling. Amazingly... it didn’t matter. Bake 30 minutes or until crust is golden."
- "Allow to cool for about 20 minutes before cutting. If you’re going to purposefully make a mistake and put cheese on top... cover it with foil half way through so that it doesn’t burn."
